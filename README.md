Module 2

## Overview of Project

Steve is assisting his parents who want to invest in stock with a company excelling in the innovative world of Green Energy. Steveâ€™s parents have not done extensive research but are focused on DAQO New Energy Corp and looking to make a 100% investment into DAQO. Steve is working to analysis a variety of Green Energy companies to see if his parents are making the best decision based on historical data of Stock Return. He has collected two years of Stock information for 12 different companies. We will offer him assistance in creating automated tasks that will help compare the data. 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Steve with the programming he needs to maximize the Stock information he has collected. 

## Results

The results for 2017 reflect all of the companies as trending in the positive (though vastly daring percentages of successfulness) with the exception of TERP.

The results for 2018 reflect a much less profitable return with the exception of ENPH and RUN. Since Green Energy is relatively a newer market; when comparing 2017 and 2018 it could be concluded that the two companies adapted to the economy and products that draw more interest.

## Summary

### Refactoring Code (General)
An advantage to refactoring code is that it allows you to retain strong code and adapt the variables and Loops to new projects without spending the time on rewriting the code. It allows for cleaner formatted code to be used repeatedly. A disadvantage could be increasing the difficulties to find the root of your error or spending more time re-designing if the intent/outcome is not strongly considered in the planning phase. 

### Original and Refactored VBA Script
The original VBA Script was easily refactored based on the similarities of the module and the challenge. The original script was able to provide a lot of learning with the formatting and button detail. The refactored script offered different loops/nested loops. The advantages were that the original script provided a clean coded outline for the refactored script; whereas, the disadvantage was spending the time to be sure the Loops were organized correctly and correcting the errors it caused.
